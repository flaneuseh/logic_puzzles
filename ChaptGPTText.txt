reponse: 

" 
Testimony of Professor Plum:

Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the opportunity to provide my testimony in this matter. On the day in question, I can confirm that I was in the Kitchen at 1:00 pm. It is a routine part of my day to engage in various intellectual pursuits, often requiring the quietude and solitude that the Kitchen provides.

As for the events that transpired later in the day, I must confess that I am not entirely certain about the occurrences in the Ballroom at 2:00 pm. My focus tends to be on my academic endeavors, and social gatherings are not typically within my purview. However, I can affirmatively state that I was not present in the Ballroom at that particular hour.

Regarding the mention of Ms. White and 3:00 pm, I must clarify that I have no connection to the events at that time. My activities are meticulously planned, and I can provide an alibi for that time frame.

Now, with respect to the relationship between the Kitchen and myself, it is true that I often find myself in that room, engrossed in my work. However, the claim that the Kitchen is at least 1 hour before my appearance is not entirely accurate. My movements are fluid and contingent on the demands of my research. I cannot be confined to a strict timetable.

In conclusion, while I can confirm my presence in the Kitchen at 1:00 pm, I cannot vouch for events in the Ballroom at 2:00 pm, and I have a solid alibi for the mention of Ms. White and 3:00 pm. The temporal relationship between the Kitchen and myself is subject to the dynamic nature of my academic pursuits.

I trust that this clarifies my position in this matter. If there are any further inquiries, I am at your disposal.

Testimony of Detective Holmes

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests and investigators, I stand before you to shed light on the intricate web of events that unfolded on that fateful afternoon. The details I present are crucial for unravelling the mystery that enshrouds this tragic incident.

First and foremost, let us consider the time frame of the crime. At 1:00 pm, the hour in question, the Kitchen takes center stage in the room category. The Kitchen, a seemingly mundane location, becomes a pivotal point in our investigation.

Now, the second clue provides us with a branching scenario. Either the Ball room is occupied at 2:00 pm, or Ms. White graces us with her presence at 3:00 pm. The plot thickens, and we must navigate this temporal labyrinth to piece together the sequence of events.

And now, the third clue introduces Professor Plum into the equation. The Kitchen, it is revealed, must be scheduled at least one hour prior to Professor Plum's appearance in the suspect category. A subtle but critical detail that tightens the narrative threads.

In summary, we are confronted with a timeline intricately woven with locations and characters. The Kitchen, the Ball room, Ms. White, and Professor Plum—all players in this mysterious drama. As we delve into the depths of these clues, the truth is poised to emerge, casting light on the shadows that conceal the identity of the perpetrator.

Let us proceed with scrutiny and diligence, for within these seemingly innocuous details lies the key to solving the enigma that haunts this mansion.
